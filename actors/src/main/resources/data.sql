He is the son of Rita (née Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He has a younger sister named Lorraine. His father owned a fabrication shop which employed 50 people, including Bean''s mother, who worked as a secretary. Despite becoming relatively wealthy (his father owned a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow), the family never moved away from the council estate as they preferred to remain close to friends and family. As a child, Bean smashed a glass door during an argument, which left a piece of glass embedded in his leg that briefly impeded his walking and left a large scar. This prevented him from pursuing his dream of playing football professionally.'
