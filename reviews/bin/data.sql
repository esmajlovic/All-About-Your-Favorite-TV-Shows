Watching the film, you cant even turn away your head not because of the tensely growing plot but also its really charming that you have no chances to pay no attention to it.The unforgettable scene left on my mind is when Holmers says, You are S-H-E-R-L-O-C-K. And that time I know he is a man hidden with deep emotion..' );

This beautiful piece of art is incredibly well written and directed, furthermore the actors are doing a tremendous job! I have read a few remarks about the pace of the show, saying it is too slow. I completely disagree, there are so many aspects which get their place in the series, every single one in its own way and it would be horrible if we would see a too fast paced show containing ridiculous cliffhangers like we see them on the major networks. Because this way you can entirely fall in love with the show, the characters and every tiny detail of the story and the best part of it, it is unbelievably addictive and makes you starve for more week after week!' );

While I may be bias as the book series is my favourite book series of all, I still think the show itself is fantastic! It sticks loyally to the books and doesnt "dumb things down" for a wider audience. If you are worried you wont gain the same experience by watching the show before you read the books, fear not - It is the same experience, with a different medium!Although, I guarantee, soon you will be so pulled into the world of Westeros you will run out and buy the books just to find out what happens next! Sit back and enjoy, my friends - Winter is Coming!' );

Please, tell me why. I dont want to add any spoilers, but every woman in this show is so much degraded, even if she was made strong in the first place. Ant that makes me even more curious of why would someone like it, except some people who hate women.. but I just cant believe that the world has so much of those..');

INSERT INTO review ( show_id, user_name, rating, review ) VALUES ( 'daredevil', 'Samir O', 90, 'They said that Marvel couldnt go dark but it did and the series is R- Rated this is one of my favorites Marvel TV Shows next to Agents Of Shield. The Cast is great and the battle scenes are amazing especially that Hallway scene EPIC. A really great TV Series and i cant wait for the new Season to come out in 2016 my only problem was the Red Daredevil suit it looked really cheap like those Fantastic 4 suits. A really great TV Show like i said and you really need to watch it if you havent see it already because Daredevil is Badass and Epic and i hope all this wait really worth it because i really want to see the Punisher and Elektra!!' );
